I am responsible for genomic analysis and software development for illumina and long read sequencing approaches. I provide bio-software development, algorithms, bioinformatics, machine learning for Illumina and LongRead sequencing technologies across all species. What i do and what i have done is outlaid below including classification of the programming languages for each task, so that you can have a broader idea of what you are looking into and what i extend. I am specific to the analysis in the areas of RNA-seq and Single cell, Metagenomics and Pangenomics covering all species. Similarly, Biological Machine and Deep learning specific to biological questions and bio-software. \
Research and Topics and areas, I dont work, read and explore: DevOPS, IOT and System Design and Management, GeoInformatics or Machine Learning. I dont write much Python and i dont do LLMs and RAG based fine tuning models for text analysis or chatbots.

ðŸ§¬ genomicssport: I work at Instytut Chemii Bioorganicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk, PoznaÅ„ Poland as area expert of a very good team and responsible for genomic analysis and software development for illumina and long read sequencing approaches. I provide bio-software development, algorithms, bioinformatics, machine learning for Illumina and LongRead sequencing technologies across all species. What i do and what i have done is outlaid below including classification of the programming languages for each task, so that you can have a broader idea of what you are looking into and what i extend. I am specific to the analysis in the areas of RNA-seq and Single cell, Metagenomics and Pangenomics covering all species. Similarly, Biological Machine and Deep learning specific to biological questions ðŸ§¬ and bio-software. ðŸ§¬ Research and Topics and areas, I dont work, read and explore: DevOPS, IOT and System Design and Management, GeoInformatics or Machine Learning.

ðŸ§¬ Sequencing specifics: \
2010-2021: Plant, Bacterial, Fungi ðŸ§¬ RNASeq, GenomSeq, Phylogenomics, PacBio Sequencing, Single Cell Analysis, Bio-software. \
2021:2023: Machine Learning, Bio-software. ðŸ§¬ \
2024: PanGenome, Bio-software.ðŸ§¬ \
2025: Human GenomicsðŸ§¬and Bio-software,Mobile and Blockchain HealthcareðŸ§¬

ðŸ§¬ Software Development:C++(2010-2021), 2024: RUST. \
ðŸ§¬ Web/Solana Development: RUST, React \
ðŸ§¬ Bioinformatics/Data Analysis/Machine and Deep Learning: Python or R depending on what needs to be used.
ðŸ§¬ Research and Topics and areas, I follow on X (previously Twitter).You will find the same on my GitHub account: 1. Bioinformatics and Computational Biology including data science ðŸ§¬. 2. Programming languages and tooling associated with the same. 3. Genomics ðŸ§¬ algorithms, Machine and deep learning.
ðŸ§¬ RUST release: See the commit tag as final or build release for the release.
